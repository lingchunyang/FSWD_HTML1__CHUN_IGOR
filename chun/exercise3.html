            Here's a little song I wrote<br>
            You might want to sing it note for note<br>
            Don't worry, be happy<br>
            In every life we have some trouble<br>
            But when you worry you make it double<br>
            Don't worry, be happy<br>
            Don't worry, be happy now<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            don't worry<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy
        </p>

        <p>
            Ain't got no place to lay your head<br>
            Somebody came and took your bed<br>
            Don't worry, be happy<br>
            The landlord say your rent is late<br>
            He may have to litigate<br>
            Don't worry, be happy<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Oh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh don't worry, be happy<br>
            Here I give you my phone number, when you worry, call me, I make you happy, don't worry, be happy)<br>
            Don't worry, be happy<br>
            Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style<br>
            Ain't got no gal to make you smile<br>
            Don't worry, be happy<br>
            'Cause when you worry your face will frown<br>
            And that will bring everybody down<br>
            So don't worry, be happy<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't worry, be happy now<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now there, is this song I wrote<br>
            I hope you learned note for note<br>
            Like good little children, don't worry, be happy<br>
            Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble<br>
            When you worry you make it double<br>
            But don't worry, be happy, be happy now<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            don't worry<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy<br>
            don't worry<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, be happy<br>
            don't worry, don't worry<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't worry, don't do it, be happy<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) put a smile in your face<br>
            (Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh) don't bring everybody down like this<br>
